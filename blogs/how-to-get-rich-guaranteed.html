        If you want to build real wealth, think in decades and be boring about
        it. Assume a 7% annual return after inflation and invest consistently.
        For example, investing <strong>$500 per month</strong> at 7% (real)
        gives you roughly:

      <p class="blog-content">
        • After 10 years: about <strong>$86,542</strong>.<br />
        • After 15 years: about <strong>$158,481</strong>.<br />
        • After 20 years: about <strong>$260,463</strong>.<br />
        • After 25 years: about <strong>$405,036</strong>.<br />
        • After 30 years: about <strong>$609,985</strong>.<br />
        • After 35 years: about <strong>$900,527</strong>.<br />
        • After 40 years: about <strong>$1,312,407</strong>.

        Those numbers are the result of steady saving plus compound growth.
        Imagine what they could look like if you invested more than $500/month.
        A Roth IRA is a powerful vehicle here because qualified withdrawals are
        tax free, which helps the long term math. The practical levers you
        control are your savings rate and your time horizon. Try to live below
        your means and direct as large a share of your income as you reasonably
        can into investments. Even moving from saving 10% of pay to 20% makes a
        huge difference over decades.
